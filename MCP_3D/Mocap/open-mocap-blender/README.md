🎬 Open Mocap — AI-Powered Motion Capture for Blender

Open Mocap is an open-source Blender add-on for AI-powered motion capture.
It supports offline full-body pose tracking, offline + real-time hand tracking, and easy retargeting to any rig.
Designed for artists, animators, and researchers who want fast, accessible motion capture inside Blender—no external software required.

⚠️ Blender & Dependencies Compatibility

Open Mocap is compatible only with Blender 4.0.0 and earlier.
Newer Blender versions currently do not support the add-on.

Best Compatibilty as of now:

Blender: 4.0.0 or earlier

Python: 3.10 (Blender’s bundled Python — no separate installation required)

MediaPipe: 0.10.14 (Must be installed using the addon)

OpenCV-Python: 4.11.0.86 (Must be installed using the addon)

CVZone: 1.6.1 (Must be installed using the addon)

> **Developer Note:**  
> To ensure Open Mocap works correctly, install the versions listed above. Using newer versions of MediaPipe, OpenCV, CVZone, or Python may cause runtime errors.
> However, developers are welcome to experiment with different versions to identify the best compatible setup. 
> ⚠️ While installing OpenCV, many times a dummy or incorrect version may be installed. Installing and uninstalling the external libraries listed above was a challenging process during development, and this may be a Blender-specific issue.
